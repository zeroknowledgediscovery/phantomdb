# ZED Submission for Phase 1

+ ./phase1


## Overview
The PREPARE Challenge is a competition organized by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to advance research and development in Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias (AD/ADRD). The challenge is designed to harness the power of data science and predictive intelligence to create innovative solutions that can help in the early diagnosis, treatment, and management of AD/ADRD.

## Challenge Phases

### Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis and Baseline Models
**Objective:** 
Participants will explore the provided datasets, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and develop baseline models. The goal is to understand the data, identify key patterns and trends, and create initial predictive models that can serve as benchmarks for further development.

**Expectations:**
- Conduct thorough EDA to uncover insights and understand the characteristics of the datasets.
- Develop and submit baseline predictive models that demonstrate initial attempts at solving the challenge.
- Document findings, methodologies, and model performance in a comprehensive report.
- Submit code and documentation according to the provided guidelines.

### Phase 2: Advanced Modeling and Optimization
**Objective:** 
Participants will refine and optimize their models from Phase 1. This phase focuses on enhancing model performance, incorporating additional data sources, and employing advanced machine learning techniques to achieve superior predictive accuracy.

**Expectations:**
- Improve and optimize the baseline models developed in Phase 1.
- Experiment with advanced machine learning techniques, such as ensemble methods, deep learning, and feature engineering.
- Incorporate additional data sources to enhance model performance, if available.
- Provide detailed documentation of the modeling process, including assumptions, challenges, and solutions.
- Submit final models, code, and comprehensive reports detailing the methodology and results.


## Evaluation Criteria
- **Accuracy:** Performance of the predictive models based on predefined metrics.
- **Innovation:** Novelty and creativity in approach and techniques used.
- **Documentation:** Clarity, thoroughness, and reproducibility of the documentation and code.
